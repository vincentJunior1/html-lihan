      <h3><!-- Tagline -->About E-money in Taiwan</h3>
      <p>Tap, Tap and Go!!!

E-Money Card is a card that you can use for Bus Transport, MRT Transport, Buy food at SuperMarket/Convenience stores, and even take gondola/inter-city buses too! So actually, we can say this card is a versatile card!

There are several companies that provide this E-Money Card service. But in general, every student card in Taiwan also cooperates with one of the companies so that it has this function.

		<p> 1. 悠遊卡 / Easy Card / Yōuyóu kǎ
The first card issued by the company is called Easy Card! Usually for the Taipei area, Easy Card has a discount after we take the MRT or ride a bicycle so it's free!</p>

		 <p> 2. 一卡通 / iPass / Yīkǎtōng
	The second company is I-Pass! They also provide this service!
    
Actually the function of these two cards is the same! It's up to you to choose which one! They also have cute designs! And what's even better, our Student Card also has this feature! But, again, it depends on what company your school works with. Both are equally good!
 </p>
		<h3><b> How to Buy?</b></h3>
		<p> As explained earlier, actually your student card also has this feature, but if you want to use an additional card, you can buy it at the Convenience Store. There are several Convenience Stores in Taiwan that provide this card, there are Seven-Eleven, Family Mart, Hi-Life, Ok Mart, and others.
 
You can also top-up at the Convenience Store, you just have to say “我要加值 Wǒ yào jiā zhí”。Besides, at the Convenience Store, you can also top-up at the MRT Station! </p>
