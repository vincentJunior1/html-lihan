      <div id="bannerImage"><img src="https://content.r9cdn.net/rimg/dimg/97/46/5b332860-city-49241-16910f885d8.jpg?crop=true&width=1020&height=498" alt=""/></div>
      <p>The attractiveness of Taichung originates in its abundant ecosystems, the ancient glamour of history, and incredible arts and literature. While endeavoring to achieve modernization as well as remember the past, Taichung strives to meet the international standards to be globally well-known as well.</p>

		<p>National Taichung Theater, nicknamed “the Most Difficult House to Accomplish” by the industry, was designed by the internationally acclaimed Japanese architect, Toyo Ito. Drawn from the concept of the Sound Cave, National Taichung Theater makes the best of its streamlined, rigid silhouette by means of modern techniques and materials, and then turns itself into an active venue.</p>
		<p>The images of streams and hanging gardens on the exterior of the opera house break the usual binary separation between stage and audience, as well as outdoors and indoors. It aims to initiate more conversations among people, art and architecture, while bringing people back to the basic aspect of life: feeling real.</p>

	<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49989427968_9872db2b80_b.jpg" width="800" height="400">
		<p>This campus is the most attractive one of all the universities in Taiwan. The buildings on the campus are modeled after the architectural style of the Tang dynasty. However, the landmark of Tunghai University is the church designed by I.M. Pei.</p>
		<p>The Luce Chapel at Tunghai University was the first example of modernist architecture in Taiwan. Created by Chinese-American architect I. M. Pei and Taiwanese architect Chen Chikwan, it is considered to be one of the most distinctive buildings of 20th century architecture around the globe. In spite of the relatively small size of the chapel, the architects were able to apply common engineering techniques to render the structure earthquake-proof as well as wind- and heat-resistant. Another unusual feature is the curvature of the building’s exterior, which allows its walls to function as both pillars and rafters at the same time. The structure, interior space, and style are perfectly integrated. The chapel’s innovative design is unmatched in Taiwan.</p>
